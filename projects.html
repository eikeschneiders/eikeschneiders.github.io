We will conduct and fund research into responsible AI, with the first calls for projects to be announced in 2023. We are developing a skills programme for those who build, buy and use AI. And we work with policymakers to explain the opportunities and risks associated with AI.</p>

                    <p>Mainstream narratives on AI tend to the extreme, focusing on either doomerism or utopianism. This project seeks to understand and explore the discourse on AI in creative communities, encouraging authentic aesthetic experiences and knowledge production in the visual arts. By gathering and analysing AI stories from various creative communities, we examine the values impacted by, and shaping responses to, (generative) AI. The research will culminate in the creation of artistic pieces to engage the general public in diverse reflections on AI and its impact. </p>
