            <p>Responsible Employment of Generative AI for Legal Services</p>
            <p>The <a href="https://regals.wp.horizon.ac.uk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Regals project</a> aims to investigate the acceptance and reliability of LLM-use in low-stake legal contexts.</p>

            <h2>TAME Pain</h2>            
            <p>TAME Pain: Trustworthy AssessMEnt of Pain - Listening between the Lines</p>
            <p>The TAME Pain project aims at developing a novel and transformative proof-of-concept autonomous system that harnesses acoustic biomarkers of pain, which will guide healthcare professionals to tailor and optimise analgesia for patients.</p>

            <p>FAILSAFE: A Socio- Technological Analysis of Human-Robot Interaction Failures for Domestic Robots</p>
            <p>The <a href="https://www.horizon.ac.uk/project/failsafe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FAILSAFE</a> project aims to develop an understanding of robotic failures and explore how people perceive and resolve robot failures as an effort to design human-robot interactions that can enhance consumer experience of future robotic systems.</p>

            <p>Cat Royale - an exploration at the intersection of Art and Human/Animal-Robot Interaction</p>
            <p>The artist-led project <a href="../catroyale.html">Cat Royale</a> aims at highlighting how an autonomous system - with humans in the loop - is built and which trade offs are involved. Furthermore, we want to understand how these technologies are going to impact on animal welfare, human welfare, and how these systems can be designed and affect trust in automative systems.</p>

            <p>UKRI Responsible Artificial Intelligence UK</p>
            <p><a href="https://www.rai.ac.uk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-rich-text-format-boundary="true">RAI UK</a> brings together researchers from across the four nations of the UK to understand how we should shape the development of AI to benefit people, communities and society. We will conduct and fund research into responsible AI, with the first calls for projects to be announced in 2023. We are developing a skills programme for those who build, buy and use AI. And we work with policymakers to explain the opportunities and risks associated with AI.</p>
