            <h2>Hello there!</h2>
            <p>My name is Eike, and I am an Assistant Professor in the Mixed Reality Lab at the University of Nottingham. As part of the TAS Hub and RAi UK, my research investigates autonomous systems and how we can ensure that these are trustworthy and responsible. This includes the design and development of these in a responsible manner, i.e., by involving various stakeholders, as well as the interaction with the system itself. Furthermore, I am interested in the impact that the introduction of autonomous systems, including robots, has on the interpersonal relationships among human (and non-human) collaborators. My focus lies on user research emphasising qualitative methods, with some use of quantitative methods to study interaction with systems in various contexts, such as the domestic space, industrial manufacturing, or at the intersection between HRI and Art. </p>
            <p>As of 2024 I have been selected to be part of the UK Foundation for Science and Technology Foundation Future Leaders Programme.</p>
            <p>I look forward to hearing from you, eike.schneiders@nottingham.ac.uk.</p>
